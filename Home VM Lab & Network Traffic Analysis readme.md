Home VM Lab & Network Traffic Analysis

Overview  
This project simulates a small network environment using virtual machines to analyze traffic patterns and explore cybersecurity fundamentals. It demonstrates hands-on skills in virtualization, packet inspection, and basic network security, which align with early SOC and GRC analyst responsibilities.

Lab Setup

\- Virtualization Tool: Oracle VirtualBox  
\- Operating Systems: Windows 10  
\- Tools Used: Wireshark, built-in ping/traceroute, browser traffic, etc.  
\- Network Configuration: NAT and Bridged Adapter to simulate internal and external communication

Objectives

\- Capture and analyze real network traffic from VMs  
\- Identify protocols (HTTP, TCP, UDP, DNS)  
\- Detect suspicious or abnormal traffic patterns  
\- Build practical networking and cybersecurity analysis skills

Skills Demonstrated

\- VM setup and network configuration (NAT, Bridged)  
\- Installation and usage of Wireshark for live traffic capture  
\- Inspection of headers, protocols, and payloads  
\- Technical documentation of cybersecurity observations

Lessons Learned

\- Understanding how common protocols behave on a live network  
\- Observing insecure vs. secure traffic  
\- Recognizing the importance of network segmentation and logging  
\- Reinforced key Security+ and CompTIA Network+ concepts
